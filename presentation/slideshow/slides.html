# Machine Learning with TensorFlow

# What is Machine Learning?

+ Methods for finding structure in or making predictions from data without explicitly programmed logic

+ Examples:
 + Image classification
 + Speech to text
 + Natural language processing
 + Spam detection
 + Recommendation engines

--

## Unsupervised vs. Supervised

+ Unsupervised methods find structure in unlabeled data
+ Supervised methods find a predictive function that fits provided input and output data
+ We'll focus on supervised learning

---

# Components of a Supervised Learning Solution

Supervised learning setups commonly include these components:

+ A **model function** mapping inputs to outputs, including configurable **parameters** that alter how the model works.

+ A **loss function** that quantifies how accurate the model is for given parameters, inputs, and outputs

+ An **optimization algorithm** that repeatedly tweaks the parameters and evaluates the loss function to improve the accuracy of the model

# Example: Linear Regression

---

Imagine we have these measurements of cricket chirp frequency at certain temperatures:

.center[
![Dataset: Temp vs. Cricket Chirps](images/linear_model_data.png "Dataset: Temp vs. Cricket Chirps")]

It looks likely that there is a linear relationship.

---

## Model
Since we think there's a linear relationship, our model is the equation for a line:

.center[_predicted_outputs = weight * inputs + bias_]

## Parameters
_weight_ and _bias_ are the parameters for this model, controlling the slope and altitude of the line.
